rocket (or missile) Instantaneous Impact Point(IIP) calculation

The instantaneous impact point (IIP) of a rocket, given its position and velocity,
is defined as its touchdown point(altitude=0[m]) assuming a free-fall flight (without propulsion).
The IIP is considered as a very important information for safe launch operation of a rocket.
